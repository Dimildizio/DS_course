A subfolder for practicing transfer learning

## Datasets
1. imagenette - regardless that imagenette is a subset of ImageNet, I still want to try fine-tuning it using freeze\unfreeze
2. hymenoptera - just two classes - ants and bees. Also gonna try fine-tuning here.

## Model
Planning to try AlexNet, ResNet, VGG, Inception v3 along with some simple custom convolution model and tinkering with hyperparameters

## Augmentations
Will be using different augmentations with Albumentations lib - resize, rotate, flip, change channels, crop, etc

## Other
### DVC
Want to try DVC for accessing shared google drive and pulling to google colab
