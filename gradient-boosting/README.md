# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This is folder of my **DS_course** Github Repository for our group project for the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle competition.

## Overview

The goal of this Kaggle competition is to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of rooms, location, and more. Our team will be using various machine learning techniques to build predictive models and determine which features have the most impact on housing prices.

## Data

The dataset for this competition includes a training set with 1,460 observations and 80 features, and a test set with 1,459 observations and 79 features (Target parameter is not included). We will be using the training set to train our models and the test set to make predictions, which we will submit to the Kaggle competition for evaluation.


## Approach

Our team plans to explore various machine learning techniques, including linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, among others. We will also use feature engineering and selection techniques to improve the performance of our models. 
Hopefully each team member will be working on different aspects of the project and contributing their work to the repository instead of leaving everything to the chosen few. If we manage to nail it this time, unlike with the EDA project, we'll hold regular meetings to discuss progress, review each other's work, and plan next steps.
We are going to control our workflow using Todoist.

## Repository Structure
Our repository is organized as follows:

**data**/: contains the training and test datasets.

**notebooks**/ contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.

**reports**/: contains reports and visualizations summarizing our findings and results.

README.md: this file.

## Next Steps
Our next steps will be to explore the data and perform exploratory data analysis to identify important features and trends. We will also develop baseline models using simple regression techniques and evaluate their performance using metrics such as mean squared error of logs of train and validation data. Finally, we will use more advanced machine learning techniques to build models that outperform the baseline models. Feature selection and feature engineering will also be performed.
